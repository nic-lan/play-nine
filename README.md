# Play Nine with React

This is a simple React game developed based on the popular [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) boilerplate

## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) in order to compile styles

* Run:
    * `npm start` — to run the app
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
    * `npm test` - to run tests
    * `npm run sass` - to watch styles
